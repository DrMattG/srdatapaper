## citation example 
Good enough[@wilson_good_2017]


```{r}
(trees <- tibble(
  species_all = c("birch; poplar",
              "oak; birch; pine",
              "",
              "poplar",
              "oak"),
  habitats_all = c(
    "wetlands",
    "forest",
    "forest, wetlands",
    "grasslands",
    "grasslands, forest"
  ),
  id = letters[1:5]
))
```



## unnesting variables

```{r}
(trees_long <- trees %>% 
  eviatlas::get_obs("species_all", "species", ";") %>% 
  eviatlas::get_obs("habitats_all", "habitats", ","))


```



## wide data

Suppose different studies observed the presence of different animals. 

```{r}
(trees_wide <- trees_long %>%
   model.matrix(~ species + habitats, .))
```

But if we wish to analyse based on the animal observations, we have multiple observations per row. To convert these data into tidy[@tidy-data] format, we need to have one animal observation per row.
